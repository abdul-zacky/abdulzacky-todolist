During the process of making the to-do app, I’ve learned numerous things. They’re vary from the very basics of flutter, to a little bit more advanced. There were things like Scaffold, setState, and a slight touch of firebase.

First thing first, there is Scaffold. This is the most basic thing that I repeatedly forgot to use. I have done several projects and always wondering why is my app looks so off, turned out I didn’t implement Scaffold in the first place.

Then, the setState. It is one of the crucial part of flutter. Without using setState, my app would be so hard to use cause I have to reload it each time I do something on it. Well, I know that there’s a substitute for this that is called State Manager. I have learned a little bit about this but my app is already finished so I didn’t have the urge to use it just now. 

The last one is firebase. I use firebase to import images from the local storage, and since I run the app on iOS, I was struggled to get the app permission for it, but it turned out so easy. 

Those are the most memorable things that I’ve learned in flutter throughout making my to-do app. The resources I used during the process are Udemy Flutter & Dart - The Complete Guide [2024 Edition], and True Coders Upload And Save Profile Image Using Flutter And Firebase.
